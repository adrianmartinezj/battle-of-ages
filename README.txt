Hi! Thanks for taking a look at my submission for the Technical Designer, Systems test.
I put together a small game that I made over the course of a couple days. It mainly includes:

-1 Level with platforms, enemies, and a goal (Level_1)
-Moving platforms which move between positions with adjustable timings
-C++ logic for the RangedEnemyCharacter which handles delays, firing states, and projectile spawning
-Game flow with Win/Loss states

I hope you enjoy your time with what I call the "Battle of Ages". If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me at adrianmartinezj@hotmail.com.
If, for whatever reason the project doesn't run or is missing files, it may be worth trying to download from my GitHub repo: 
https://github.com/adrianmartinezj/battle-of-ages.git.

To develop this platformer, I was using Unreal Engine version 5.3.2.
